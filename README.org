* Nelthorim's Dotfiles
  This is a personal repository intended to store my current Linux (and Windows,
  believe it or not!) configurations. You can use them as reference, or use them
  as is if they suit you that well.
** Installation
   Use the Makefile recipes as wanted. By default, ~make all~ will install the
   recipes for fish, emacs and git, with vim and bash left as optionals as they
   are not part of my current workflow.
